This allow you to keep object buffer for your C structure
that we call object here.

What it can do,

-- You can do GC on this buffer.
-- You can find an object in this buffer list.
-- You can find a list of objects from the buffer list.
-- You can enable locking for threadsafe factory operation.
		Additionaly you can write your own object mutex.

What it cannot do, or what we may do in future.

-- You cannot sort the list.
-- There is no error-list to help try catch features.
